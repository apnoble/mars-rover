# Mars Rovers

## Getting Started
To run this application, you will need Node.js to be installed on your computer. It can be downloaded from [Node JS](https://nodejs.org)

When you want to run the application for the first time, run the command `npm i` in the root directory of the project to download all the necessary dependencies.


## Running the Application

Once you have downloaded the dependencies, you can use the command `npm run start` in the root directory which will launch the app in a new window (or tab) in your default browser.


## Unit Testing
To run the unit tests, you can use the command `npm run test` in the root directory. It will output the results of the tests to the console, but will also display the results in a browser window.



## Notes
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.
If you run into issues it might be helpful to install the angular-cli (but I believe it is not necessary for it to be installed) or consult the help page at [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli)

Thank you!
